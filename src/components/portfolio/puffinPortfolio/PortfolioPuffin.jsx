						This was a project where I was required to
						alongside another graduate to design and create a
						website for the company Future Careâ€™s product, Puffin.
						Puffin is a brand for baby monitoring devices. We
						designed and created the front-end of an e-commerce
						website and began development into the back-end by
						creating a login system. The project entailed developing
						three websites relating to the brand called Puffin
						Group, Puffin Club and My Puffin.
